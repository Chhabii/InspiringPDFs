# Flow Explanation:
### Upload and Data Extraction:

- The user uploads PDFs, which are processed to extract textual data.
### Text Chunking and Embedding:

- Extracted text is split into chunks and embedded into vectors.
### Vector Store and Compression:

- Embeddings are stored in a vector store. Compression techniques are applied to optimize storage.
### Memory and Query Processing:

- Memory techniques store conversation context. The user's query is processed to retrieve relevant documents.
### Context Building and Response Generation:

- Context is built from retrieved documents. The system generates responses using the context and memory.
### User Interaction and Chat History:

- The user interface displays chat history, showing the interactive conversation flow.
